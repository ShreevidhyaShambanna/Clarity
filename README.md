Overview
Clarity is a conversational support system built to promote emotional wellness through empathetic and context-aware interactions. The project combines natural language processing and machine learning to understand user input, recognize emotional tone, and respond in a supportive, reflective manner. Rather than offering direct clinical advice, Clarity focuses on fostering awareness, connection, and safe self-expression.

Data Sources
The project leverages several open-source mental health conversation datasets hosted on Hugging Face. These datasets contain anonymized dialogues focused on emotional well-being, counseling, and supportive communication. They are used for fine-tuning and evaluating the conversational model.
